                    <article>
                        <p>One day, you woke up and everything just... disappearas. In one night. The great city you
                            live in?
                            Ruins. The big monument your people build to celebrate? Didn't make it. Your family and
                            friends?
                            No where to be found. So what would you do? Sit down and cries? No ma'am, you set out to a
                            journey.
                            An adventure. To find the answer.

                        <p>Saving the world ain't no easy task. But if you don't do it, who will? Now of course killin'
                            monster
                            and running around rescuing people is good, but what good is there when those people you
                            rescued have
                            no place to go home? As the saying goes, there is no place like home. When you lost your
                            place to go back to,
                            you lost your hope.

                            Town destroyed. Some weird, huge monsters comes out of nowhere. Some people survived, some
                            people died, adn others just disappears.
                            No one konws why. Maybe you can help us find the answer.

                        <p>Most of our towns were destroyed by monsters. They appears out of thin air, and just started
                            a mayhem. Many brave warriors have died fighting them.
                            We don't know anything about them other than they're huge, bleeds orange fluid, and comes in
                            different shape and weapons.
                        </p>

                        <p>Lucky for us, as a species who likes to kill each other, we have developed some weapons that
                            can fight them.
                            We call our weapon "Gears", a huge, mechanical robots we build to slay Gods. Maybe those
                            monsters are Gods that we pissed by building these thing.

                            it from ohter survivor.
                            As they said, money can buy ANYTHING. Maybe you can loot it from some of our fallen warrior.
                            Or maybe you can just build one yourself.
